Descriptions:
- 'large_no_velocity': what happens when we run a simulation with zero impact velocity,
- 'large_old_code_45': a simulation run with a bug from our earliest simulation attempts, including material getting stuck 'between' grid cells, leading to an infinite point source of molten silicates, fondly referred to as our 'infinite magma waterfall from space',
- 'large_wrong_angle': in the discrepancy between the small impacts community and the large impacts community in how impact angle is defined (from the horizontal and the vertical, respectively); in this simulation, the two are confused, leading to the impactor leaving to the left of the simulation space, without ever impacting onto the planet.
