# iSALE3D Impact Simulations

## by J. P. Itcovitz, Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge

This repository acts as a platform for sharing the impact simulations ran in association with Itcovitz et al. (in prep.), which looked towards analyzing how iron from the impactor core accretes to the target planet in such impacts.

Impact parameters are detailed in their file names, in the format: "mass_velocity_angle"
- Mass (kg): Large -> 2e22; Mid -> 6e21; Small -> 2e21
- Velocity (km s-1): Fast -> 20.0; Mid -> 16.0; Slow -> 11.2
