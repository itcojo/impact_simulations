# iSALE3D Impact Simulations

## (authorship anonymous for review process)

This repository acts as a platform for sharing impact simulations ran in association with the manuscript, which analyze how the cores of large impactors accrete to an Earth-like planet. 

**Impact parameters** are detailed in their file names, in the format: "mass_velocity_angle"
- _Mass (kg)_: Large -> 3.6e22; Mid -> 8.4e21; Reg -> 5.1e21; Small -> 2.8e21
- _Velocity (km/s)_: Fast -> 20.0 (~2.0 v_esc); Mid -> 16.0 (~1.5 v_esc); Slow -> 11.2 (~1.0 v_esc)
(Videos are additionally labeled by the Eulerian grid property being shown. If no such label is provided, the video shows the evolution of tracer particles.)

**Directories**: 
- _45_deg_impactors_: impact simulations with impact angle 45 degrees and impact velocity of 16 km/s (approx. most likely values in the parameter distributions),
- _24_hour_simulations_: impact simulations with the 'large' impactor mass, mpact angle 45 degrees, and impact velocity of 16 km/s, with simulation end times of 24 hours (instead of the standard 3 hours); videos for simulations including and excluding material strength are shown,
- _notable_impacts_: impact simulations demonstrating concepts that are important for the manuscript, including large escaping mass fractions of impactor core material, secondary impacts of impactor core material, head-on impacts, and 'huge' size impacts (1.7e23 kg).
- _bloopers_: entertaining impact simulations that we created along the way.
